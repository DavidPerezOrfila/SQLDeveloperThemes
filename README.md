* Close SQL Developer. This is important. If you modify the scheme file while SQL Developer is open, your changes won't be saved.

* Locate file `dtcache.xml` in the SQL Developer's settings directory (On windows it is located in directory `C:\Users\yourUser\AppData\Roaming\SQL Developer\systemxx.xx.xx.xx.xx\o.ide.xx.x.x.x.xx.xxxxxx.xxxx`) and replace it.
